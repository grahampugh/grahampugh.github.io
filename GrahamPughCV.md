Mac Systems Administration
=====================

At the University of Bristol, I identified the need for improved Mac management and support systems and policies due to increasing Mac real estate and a diversifying set of users.  I lobbied within the IT Services organisation to the benefits of designing and developing these improvements.  I set up and chaired a group of experts to assist, and delivered an integrated management solution for Mac computers using Open Source software including Munki, AutoPkg and DeployStudio, enabling rapid imaging of, managed deployment of software to, and hugely improved security compliance for over 1300 Mac computers.  My team also vastly improved online support and documentation of Mac support issues and processes, setup communication strategies to ensure that Mac users in the University are kept informed and up-to-date with regard to important issues, and unified and improved the purchasing and repair processes.  The improvements I instigated have ensured a low incident count from Mac users, reduced the burden on IT Support staff, and resulted in good incident feedback.

Linux Systems Administration
=====================

I have experience in:  

   * Second Line Linux server support (CentOS/SL)
   * First and second line Linux desktop support (Ubuntu/CentOS/SL/SuSE)
   * Running services in Docker containers
   * Standard Ubuntu desktop deployment using Puppet
   * HPC cluster setup and management (Rocks/CentOS)
   * Apache/PHP/MySQL setup, virtual hosts, SELinux
   * Data management
   * Virtual Machine configuration (CentOS 6/7, Ubuntu)

Windows Systems Administration
=====================

I have experience in:

   * Active Directory user/group/computer policy management
   * Systems Center Configuration Management (SCCM 2012)
   * Hyper-V virtual machine management
   * Integration of Macs and Linux PCs into an AD environment

Software Development
=====================

I have developed bespoke software using Python, Shell and AppleScript, and contribute to the Open Source community by publishing these applications and scripts. 

Web Development
=====================

I am skilled in PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Django.

Second Line Support
=====================

   * Provide solutions to second line incidents, providing a fix where possible to prevent recurrence, or ensuring good documentation of the solutions so that incident recurrence is easily dealt with as a first line incident.
   * Liaison with stakeholders to agree policy.
   * Respond to feedback from stakeholders and problem users.
   * Set up Drop-In sessions to ensure that IT Support has a visible presence
   * Proactive support - identify opportunities for service improvement rather than reacting at the point of a critical mass of incidents.

First Line Support
=====================

   * Prioritise incident response efficiently and intelligently, based on SLA, incident seriousness, geographical considerations etc, to maximise incident completion rates.
   * Broad knowledge of local IT systems in order to be able to solve as many incidents as possible.
   * Effective delegation to relevant members of my team (or other teams) to maximise efficiency.

Documentation
=====================

I am a great proponent of documentation in IT Services organisations, and have, over recent years, strove to develop skills in the production of effective knowledge bases for IT staff and clear, concise, accessible support web pages for end users of IT.
