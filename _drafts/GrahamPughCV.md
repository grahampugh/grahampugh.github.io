<br>Mission
---------------------

---

I am an experienced I.T. technician, expert in supporting staff in the education sector with all aspects of their computing needs. My interests lie in efficiency of support, which involves identifying and automating repetitive support processes where possible, standardising, and optimising communication to empower both IT staff and end users, with the goal to reduce support incidents whilst at the same time improving customer satisfaction. 

At the University of Bristol, I identified that due to increasing Mac real estate and a diversifying set of users, the need for improved Mac management and support systems and policies became paramount.  I set up and chaired a group of fellow experts, and delivered an integrated management solution for Mac computers using Open Source Software, enabling rapid imaging of, managed deployment of software to, and hugely improved security compliance for over 1300 Mac computers.  My team also vastly improved online support and documentation of Mac support issues and processes, setup communication strategies to ensure that Mac users in the University are kept informed and up-to-date with regard to important issues, and unified and improved the purchasing and repair processes.  The improvements I instigated have ensured a low incident count from Mac users, reduced the burden on IT Support staff, and resulted in improved incident feedback.
