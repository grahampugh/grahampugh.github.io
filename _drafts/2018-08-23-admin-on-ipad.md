title:  "Mac Administration using an iPad"
comments: true

I have recurring back problems, and have struggled for a while to carry heavy rucksacks to and from work containing my Mac laptop, power block etc. Two years ago I was given a 2015 15" MacBook Pro for work, and that was no good at all; far too heavy. My personal 11" MacBook Air was pretty good, but that just recently died. I have use of a 13" TouchBar MacBook Pro, which is only marginally heavier than the MacBook Air, but still I have been uncomfortable carrying it around for extended periods of time. 

I started to wonder whether I could use an iPad to do my admin work while on the road. The release of the 2018 iPad gave me a cheap excuse to test this out, so I bought one last week.

Although the 2018 iPad doesn't have all the features of an iPad Pro, such as Force Touch, split screen apps, and the Smart Keyboard Connectors, so far I have found it to be a capable device for many of my needs.

## Editing code and working with a Git repository 

A few months ago, a colleague told me about **Working Copy**, an app for iOS which connects to Git repositories and allows cloning, pulling, pushing and working on the repository. You need to purchase the Enterprise version to push to a Git repository, so this is basically essential.

Working Copy is extremely capable. Not restricted to GitHub, it can also be configured to connect to BitBucket, GitLab and others. It can generate an SSH key for key-based authentication to your repo using SSH. With VPN configured, I have been able to connect to our private on-premises GitLab repository. 

Editing code is surprisingly possible. Copy-pasting on an iPad still leaves a lot to be desired, and this is probably the most frustrating aspect, along with overzealous auto-correction, the "undo" button going too far back in history, and some strange auto-highlighting effects that lead to frequent overtyping. I've also been used to using Atom for the past few years
