<img align="right" style="margin-right:25px;margin-bottom:50px" src="/assets/images/ukraine-heart.png" width="300" />I do not accept sponsorship for my work for the Mac community. I am very lucky to be well paid for my work.

However, in these sad times, I would be honoured if you would consider donating to the [United Nations Refugee Agency][1], the [International Committee of the Red Cross][2], any other charity that is trying to help victims of Russia's terrible war in Ukraine, or victims of the world's other tyrants.
