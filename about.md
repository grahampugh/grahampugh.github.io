I am an IT Systems Specialist, currently developing Mac Support and Management strategies for a major British University, and contributing to the development of Open Source Mac Management Software.  Testing.

I have a Ph.D. in Geochemistry, and I enjoy the interface between science and computing.  I place strong importance in understanding and responding to the computing requirements of academics, particularly in scientific disciplines.    

At other times, I like to run, cycle, climb up rock faces and travel the world.
