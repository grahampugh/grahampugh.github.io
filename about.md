I am a Mac Support Specialist from the U.K., currently living and working in Switzerland.

I have a Ph.D. in Geochemistry, and I enjoy the interface between science and computing.  I place strong importance in understanding and responding to the computing requirements of scientists, academics and educators.    

At other times, I like to run, cycle, climb up rock faces and travel the world.
