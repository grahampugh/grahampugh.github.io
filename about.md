I was born in Ormskirk, Lancashire, United Kingdom, and I am currently living in Germany and working as a Senior Systems Engineer at Jamf.

Although I studied Geochemistry, and qualified with a [Ph.D. studying Glacial Meltwater Chemistry][1] at [Aberystwyth University][3] ([read it here!][2]), I didn't succeed in that career, but soon realised my true talents lay in IT support. I have been lucky to work supporting the computing needs of teachers and academics in scientific institutions pretty much ever since, first as an IT Technician and Web Designer for a [specialist technology school in Somerset, England][4], later as an IT Support Technician, Subject Specialist and [Mac Specialist at Bristol University][5], and as a Senior Apple Systems Engineer at [ETH ZÃ¼rich][6] in Switzerland.

At other times, I like to run, hike, cycle, climb/boulder, learn German, and travel the world.
