On Thursday, 03 October 2024, I was honoured to present at the [MacSysAdmin Online Conference](https://docs.macsysadmin.se/2024/) alongside Katiuscia Zehnder of ETH ZÃ¼rich, on the topic **Automated Testing of Managed Applications (As Part of a Fully Automated Software Deployment Workflow)**.

This was my first time attending the MacSysAdmin conference in person, and it was a wonderful event. I highly recommend the conference to any Mac Admin of any level of experience. 

Sharing the stage with Kati was a lot of fun. If there are any of you who are interested in presenting for the first time but intimidated by the thought of creating a 55 minute presentation, consider asking one of us more experienced presenters (maybe you have a colleague) if they would co-present.

This post contains links to the slides and video.
