<img align="right" src="/assets/images/psumac2022logo.png" alt="PSU MacAdmins 2022 Logo" width="150" height="150" />On 14 July 2022, I was once again fortunate to co-present with [Anthony Reimer][1], this time at the [MacAdmins 2022 Campfire Sessions][2], on the topic **Demystifying JamfUploader - Taking Your Jamf AutoPkg Workflows to the Next Level**.

This presentation is intended to be a deeper dive and update to our [2021 JNUC presentation][3] about [JamfUploader].

## Resources

Anthony has written a blog post including links to the slides [here][4].
