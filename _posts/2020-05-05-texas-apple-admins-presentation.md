I am honoured to be joining illustrious presenters at the [Texas Apple Admins Virtual Meetup][1] today, 5 May 2020, to talk about multiple uses for my [erase-install] tool. If you are interested and haven't already done so, register using the link [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/texas-apple-admins-virtual-meetup-tickets-103709321372).

The presentation will not be recorded live, but I will record it separately and post the presentation here.

The slides will also be available here shortly afterwards, for anyone who wants to go through at their own pace.
