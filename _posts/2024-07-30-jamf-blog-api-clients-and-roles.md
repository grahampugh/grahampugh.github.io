Last week I posted an article in Jamf's official blog regarding how to use the new API Roles and Clients in Jamf Pro. API Roles and Clients provide a more secure way of integrating with the API than using regular accounts.

A bonus section shows how to use the Jamf Pro API to create and manage the API Roles, which is something you may wish to automate if you are handling multiple Jamf Pro instances.
