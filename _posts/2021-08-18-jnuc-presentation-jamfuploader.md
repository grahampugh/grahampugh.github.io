On 21 October 2021, at 02:00 PM CDT (21:00 Central European Time), I am proud to be co-presenting with Anthony Reimer at the [Virtual JNUC 2021](https://www.jamf.com/events/jamf-nation-user-conference/2021/), on the following topic:

**Making package uploading and deployment easier with JamfUploader**

[AutoPkg] is a community framework for capturing software installers from external or internal sources, automating the process of packaging these installers, and uploading the packages to a management system such as Jamf Pro, avoiding the need to manually obtain and package up software. Using a concept of "recipes", which can be shared via GitHub, members of the Mac Admin community can easily benefit from and contribute to the pooled resources to minimise duplication of effort.

[JamfUploader][jamfuploader] is a new set of AutoPkg processors which facilitates the import of software packages into Jamf Pro using the Jamf Pro API.

In this session, Anthony and I will introduce JamfUploader and help attendees understand how to construct AutoPkg recipes using the processors, giving simple and more advanced examples.

## See you there

If you are attending Virtual JNUC, Anthony and I hope that we will leave you with some new ideas on how to use AutoPkg in your organisation to improve your automation. We will be available for Q&A during and after the session. If you cannot attend live, there will be a video available a short time afterwards.

I will be compiling a comprehensive list of resources to accompany the session, which I will publish when the session is streamed.
