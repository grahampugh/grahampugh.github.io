Back on 19th March 2015 I gave a short informal presentation at the second [London Apple Admins] meeting at ThoughtWorks London, about how I've been using [Docker] to setup some Mac administration tools, with the examples of [Crypt], [Munki-Trello] and [Munki-Enroll]. Here's my segment:

The excellent hosts [Ben Toms][@macmuleblog], [Steve Quirke][@steve2cv] and [Graham Gilbert][@grahamgilbert] also gave presentations about [Bushel], Docker and [Sal] respectively.
